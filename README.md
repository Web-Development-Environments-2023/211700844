# Assignment 1 - Internet development environments course

As part of the assignment we were required to create a website about an adult character

The site I made is about Yoram Gaon - an elderly figure who is very much appreciated by me. 

I appreciate Yehoram Gaon because he is an old man of the country who contributed a lot to the development and establishment of culture in it.

## Comments to the examiner

I invested a lot in the work - I used as many designs and ideas as possible (colors, clicking on images, enlarging an image with the movement of the mouse and much more)

I learned a lot from the job
